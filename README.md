# PyQSOFit Run Scripts
 Codes used to run PyQSOFit and analyse the results

These codes include the original PyQSOFit codes (version 1.2) by Guo, Shen, and Wang (2018). An updated version is found here: https://github.com/legolason/PyQSOFit.

In addition, scripts to run the codes and analyse the results are included. These are named: QSOParFITS_Run.py (which sets up the parameter file to be used for PyQSOFit), Fitting-Script.py (the script used to run PyQSOFit with optional plots for each line complex), and LineProfile_Analysis.py (analyses the results from Fitting-Script.py, specifically for measuring properties of BL profiles).
