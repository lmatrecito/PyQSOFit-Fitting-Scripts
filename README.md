# PyQSOFit Run Scripts
 Codes used to run PyQSOFit and analyse the results

These codes include the original PyQSOFit codes (version 1.2) by Guo, Shen, and Wang (2018). An updated version is found here: https://github.com/legolason/PyQSOFit.

In addition, scripts to run the codes and analyse the results are included. These are named: QSOParFITS_Run.py, Fitting-Script.py, and LineProfile_Calc.py.

NOTE: It is a WIP to update LineProfileCalc.py to LineProfile_Analysis.py. This update condenses the code so that it is more user friendly since my original coding basically hard coded everything just to make sure it worked :)
